2. Content Requirements:

   - Begin each major section with a brief overview
   - Use clear, concise language suitable for the target audience
   - Include practical examples for all main features
   - Provide troubleshooting guides for common issues
   - Add cross-references between related sections
   - Include version compatibility information where relevant

3. Markdown Formatting Rules:

   - Use proper heading levels (# for h1, ## for h2, etc.)
   - Format code blocks with appropriate language tags (`go, `bash, etc.)
   - Use tables for structured information
   - Include blockquotes (>) for important notes or warnings
   - Utilize bullet points and numbered lists appropriately
